# XAI to predict distress of Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)
The following paper presents the project that I conducted in the scope of the lecture ’Advanced Ma- chine Learning’. I extended the experiments conducted by the authors of [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jofi.13228), which used linear and instrumental variable regression techniques with different levels of fixed effects, by using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) on a selected group of experiments.
The authors made use of the interpretability of a regression model, in order to research which features most influence the outcome of Commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS).
The goal of this project is to show that XAI is not only a powerful framework to conduct predictions, but is also a valid alternative to common approaches from fields like econometrics in terms of explainability, such as the regression approach.
